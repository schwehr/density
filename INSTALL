Basic Installation Of Density
=============================

WARNING 1:

Density does not yet have a GNU Autoconf setup, so things will be a
bit trickier than the usual ./configure.

WARNING 2:

To date, the density package has only been built and tested on Mac OSX
10.3.5 with fink 0.22.2/0.7.1.cvs



First, make sure you have all the tools needed for building:

0.  If you haven't already done so, install Apple's X-Code, Apple's
	X11, and Apple's X11SDK.

1.  Install fink and FinkCommander from http://fink.sf.net

2.  Using FinkCommander preferences, enable unstable and do an update
	with rsync.

3.  Install these soqt, simvoleon, gsl

4.  Optionally install: gengetopt, html2man, doxygen

5.  You may want to install man2html
	 (not in fink, see http://freshmean.net)


Now build and test the package:

6.  Get a menu from make:

	make

7.  See what the issues currently are in the source:

	make check | less

8.  Build and test everything:

	make test

9.  Optionally build the documentation:

	make docs
	make man	# requires man2html

10. Cleanup and rebuild for speed:

	make clean
	make targets-no-test OPTIMIZE=1

11. Install - Put the programs somewhere, for example:

	cp s_bootstrap simpleview xyzdensity xyz_iv xyzvol_cmp vol2vol \
		volhdr_edit volinfo vol_iv volmakecmap histogram makeCDF \
		~/bin
